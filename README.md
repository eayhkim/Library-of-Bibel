In "The Library of Babel," Jorge Luis Borges conceives of a library composed of an uncountable number of hexagonal rooms filled with books. The Library is "'total'--perfect, complete, and whole--and [...] its bookshelves contain all possible combinations of the twenty-two orthographic symbols (a number which, though unimaginably vast, is not infinite)--that is, all that is able to be expressed, in every language." 

This project is a modern interpretation of Borges' Library of Babel, which is mostly faithful to the story except for one major change. Borges's library was limited to the 22 symbols used in predominantly European languages. To truly express "all that is able to be expressed," this library contains every possible sequence of binary digits (of length 32000). Each page can be read as utf-32, but you may notice that pages that are meaningful to the human eye make up an unfathomable minority of all of the pages that the library contains.

Running `library_computation.py` yields a terminal UI to navigate the library. You can browse random pages, search for pages with specific content, or view a handful of bookmarked pages of interest. Each page can be viewed as the underlying binary text, or as utf-32 encoded unicode.

# Acknowledgements
The underlying code for this library uses the hashing algorithm implemented by louis-e (repository at https://github.com/louis-e/LibraryOfBabel-Python). Taking louis-e's code as a base, I modified the algorithm to generate libraries that use character sets of any size, as well as added a user interface. Initial inspiration was taken from the Library of Babel website created by Jonathan Basille (https://libraryofbabel.info/), and, of course, the original short story by Jorge Luis Borges. The interface is built through the Textual python framework (https://textual.textualize.io/). I also received valuable help, feedback, and advice from friends at the Recurse Center in the summer of 2025, especially Claire Froelich (https://clairefro.dev/).

# Additional musings: what does the library mean?
To me, the Library of Babel crystallizes many of the reasons why I find the study of human language so compelling. 

First, it makes apparent that there are an infinite number of possibilities for what language *could* look like, and within that infinite set, there is a vastly smaller infinity that describes that language *does* look like. One might realize that the differences between Chinese and English and Sanskrit are only surface level; there is something remarkably consistent, albeit nebulous, that all human languages have in common, and that the uncountable pages of completely random gibberish do not. What is this ineffable quality of all human language? Is it tied to what makes us human? I think it must be.

In astronomical terms, it reminds me of how we are underlyingly made of the same atoms as everything else in the universe, but it feels deeply significant that out of all the infinite ways those atoms could be composed, they are composed in the shape of earth, and living creatures, and you, and me. And to our knowledge, they are not composed in quite the same way anywhere else in the uncountable galaxies around us. Why is that so? And how is it so? These feel like questions that demand investigation.

Another idea that I find useful when looking at the library is that the encoding we use to derive information from its pages is itself completely arbitrary. Borges references this idea when the narrator of "The Library of Babel" says, "for many years it was believed that those impenetrable books were in ancient or far-distant languages." Text that seems meaningless to us might actually be meaningful if we only have the right frame of knowledge to interpret it. A page of English text will be "impenetrable" to someone who does not know English.

The original library as proposed in Borges's story used 22 orthographic characters to encode "all that is able to be expressed, in every language." However, the fact that we interpret these 22 orthographic symbols as particular sounds themselves feels quite arbitrary. In this implementation of the library, the underlying text is represented in binary, which is only legible once it is read as utf-32, rendering all the 1,114,112 possible characters represented by the unicode system. But one could interpret strings of binary data any way one might wish, and it is only by arbitrary social convention that one 32-bit sequence is interpreted as "a" and another is "ÈÅì." The Library of Babel leads me to appreciate that human language itself is mysteriously rare and significant, but even beyond that, it is mysterious, rare, and significant that we as individuals choose to interpret language in the specific way that we do.

Put succinctly, the library illustrates 1) that there is something (perhaps ineffable) that separates human language from random noise, and 2) that there is something (perhaps ineffable) that determines what we choose to interpret as meaningful.
